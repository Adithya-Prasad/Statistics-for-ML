# What is Statistics?

_Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. - Wiki_

It's the main ingredient of Data Analytics and Data Science. 

# Types of Statistics.
  
  ## 1. Descriptive Statistics
        _ It mainly summarizes(max, min, mean, median, range etc) the data from a population or sample. 

  ## 2. Inferential Statistics
        _ Used when we need to analyze the properties of the data and use a hypothesis or some statistical analysis to make predictions on a larger population of data or take decision/action on the data. 
        
        Example: Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA, Chi-Square, Z Test, T Test, F Test, Mann-Whitney Test, Regression Analysis, Time-Series Analysis, Etc.


# Population and Sample - Sampling Technique

  ## What is Population and Sample?
  ### Population:
         The entire dataset under investigation/analysis is the Population(N).
  ### Sample:
         A chunk of Population(n).
  
## Sampling:
  It is a statistical analysis of a fixed number of observations drawn from the whole population.

## Sampling Techniques

### 1. Simple Random Sampling:
Every data point/Individual has an equal chance of being selected

### 2. Systematic Sampling:
The first individual is randomly selected, and the others are selected using a fixed sampling interval(ith interval). There is no rule in choosing the interval.

Example: Let's say we have a dataset with 100 rows. We randomly select the first row (let's say 2nd row we selected). Then we will keep a fixed interval (say, every third row). My sample data will be taken from the following rows: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14...... 

### 3. Stratified Sampling:
Here the population is split into **non-overlapping groups**.

Example: If we are surveying the Job Satisfaction Index, Then if we consider Strata/layer/part of Engineers and Doctors there is a little chance that the Engineer's features/characteristics overlap with the Doctor's. There is no relationship between these two groups. So we will select some values from both the groups as samples from the population.


# Variables:

Variable can contain any value. 

There are two types of Variables.
1. Quantitative Variable (Measured numerically; Ex: Age, Marks)
2. Qualitative/Categorical Variables (Based on some characteristics we can categorise the variable; Ex: Gender, Blood Groups)

## Quantitative Variables:

Divided into:
1. Discrete variables: (Whole Number; These are fixed values; ex: Children in Family, Number of bank accounts etc)
2. Continuous variables: (variable that can take on any value within a range. A continuous variable takes on an infinite number of possible values)

## Qualitative Valriables: Also Called Variable Measurement Scales

4 types of Measured Variable:
1. Nominal(Named) Variable/data: (Gender, Boolean, Color, Types of Flower, etc)
2. Ordnial(ordered) variable/data: (Contains Hierarchy/Ranking ; ex: Socio Economica Status, Education Level, Satisfaction Index etc.)
3. Interval : (range of values will be present and order also matters, Ex: Age brackets)
4. Ratio data: In a ratio scale, you can take a ratio of two values. Example 40 kg is twice as heavy as 20 kg (taking ratios).
    Here are some examples of ratio variables:
        -  Temperature in Kelvin: The Kelvin scale has a true zero (0 K) where nothing can be colder. This allows you to calculate ratios of temperatures in the Kelvin scale. 
        -  Age: Age has a true zero point, which means that a value of zero represents the absence of age. 
        -  Number of children in a household: You can say that 4 children is twice as many as 2 children in a household. 
        -  Years of work experience: You can say that 8 years is double 4 years of experience.

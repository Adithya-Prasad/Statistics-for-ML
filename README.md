# What is Statistics?

_Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. - Wiki_

It's the main ingredient of Data Analytics and Data Science. 

# Types of Statistics.
  
  ## 1. Descriptive Statistics
        _ It mainly summarizes(max, min, mean, median, range etc) the data from a population or sample. 

  ## 2. Inferential Statistics
        _ Used when we need to analyze the properties of the data and use a hypothesis or some statistical analysis to make predictions on a larger population of data or take decision/action on the data. 
        
        Example: Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA, Shi-Square, Regression Analysis, Time-Series Analysis, Etc.


# Population and Sample - Sampling Technique

  ## What is Population and Sample?
  ### Population:
         The entire dataset under investigation/analysis is the Population(N).
  ### Sample:
         A chunk of Population(n).
  
## Sampling:
  It is a statistical analysis of a fixed number of observations drawn from the whole population.

## Sampling Techniques

### 1. Simple Random Sampling:
Every data point/Individual has an equal chance of being selected

### 2. Systematic Sampling:
The first individual is randomly selected, and the others are selected using a fixed sampling interval(ith interval). There is no rule in choosing the interval.

Example: Let's say we have a dataset with 100 rows. We randomly select the first row (let's say 2nd row we selected). Then we will keep a fixed interval (say, every third row). My sample data will be taken from the following rows: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14...... 

### 3. Stratified Sampling:
Here the population is split into **non-overlapping groups**.

Example: If we are surveying the Job Satisfaction Index, Then if we consider Strata/layer/part of Engineers and Doctors there is a little chance that the Engineer's features/characteristics overlap with the Doctor's. There is no relationship between these two groups. So we will select some values from both the groups as samples from the population.
